# Hello-CI/CD
Quick intro to get hands on experience with CI CD and github actions.

- This test uses a linux VM and setups python installs pytest runs the test from "tests" folder and marks the build as passed/failed depending on results.

# Why use CI/CD:
  - Developers dont need to run tests manually
  - When developing code with multiple people working on it code can cause merger conflicts.
